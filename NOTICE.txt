**Used Codecs Notice**

The following codecs are used when converting videos:

- **H.264 (libx264)** and **AAC**: These codecs are widely used and supported, but are subject to software patents in certain jurisdictions. Use in commercial or distributed applications may require a patent license from relevant entities such as MPEG LA.  
  More info: https://www.mpegla.com/programs/avc/  
  FFmpeg includes an open implementation (`libx264`, `aac`), but the use of these codecs may still require a license in some cases.

- **VP8 (libvpx)** and **Vorbis (libvorbis)**: These codecs are open and royalty-free. They are safe to use in both open source and commercial applications.
